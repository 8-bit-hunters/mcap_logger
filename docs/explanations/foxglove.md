[Foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/) helps robotics teams to explore, collaborate on, and make sense of their robots'
data - for more intelligent
iteration and accelerated development.

Because of its capability of importing and streaming multimodal data (video, image, lidar sensor, etc.) and displaying
them over its highly configurable layout, it is a good choice for robotics development.

**This is the reason why we are aiming to have full compatibility
with [its message schemas](https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs/visualization/message-schemas/introduction).**
