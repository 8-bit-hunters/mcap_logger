# Installation

The MCAP Logger is published as a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/mcap-logger/) and can be installed with
`pip`, ideally using
a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/#using-pip-in-a-python-virtual-environment).
We can also use a package and project manager like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
or [uv](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) to handle the environment for us.

=== "pip"

    ```shell
    pip install mcap-logger
    ```

=== "Poetry"

    ```shell
    Poetry add mcap-logger
    ```

=== "uv"

    ```shell
    uv add mcap-logger
    ```

!!! tip "Python package and project managers"

    The best is to use a Python package and project manager,
    this would make the managing of packages and virtual environments way easier. Here is how to install
    [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    and setup a project.
